## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## Subset data to only include kelp bass
bass1 <- subset(fishData, SP_CODE=="PCLA")

## Remove all -99999 from dataset
bass2 = bass1[-which(bass1$SIZE < 0),]

## Include only the columns of interest to simplify the dataset
bass3 = bass2[c("YEAR", "SITE", "SP_CODE", "SIZE", "COUNT")]

## Replicates the rows based on the values of the "COUNT" column
index <- rep(1:nrow(bass3), bass3$COUNT)
bass_size <- bass3[index, ]

```


```{r}
##Calculate the average size of the kelp bass at each YEAR and SITE
head(bass_size)
bass_avg = bass_size %>% group_by(YEAR, SITE, SP_CODE) %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(SIZE), funs(mean))

##Plot average size of kelp bass by site by year 
## The colors in each site give you a rough idea of the relative average size between sites in a given year 
ggplot(bass_avg, aes(x=YEAR, y=SIZE))+
  geom_col(aes(fill=SITE))+
  labs(y="Total size across all sites")+
  ggtitle("Average size of bass across sites and years")

```
```{r}
## Filter out all sites except MOHK, CARP (non MPAs) and IVEE and NAPLES (MPAs)
bass_comp = bass_avg[which(bass_avg$SITE %in% c("MOHK", "CARP", "IVEE", "NAPL")),]

##Make a column that outputs "CONTROL" if CARP or MOHK. Will output "MPA" if IVEE or NAPL. 
bass_comp$status <- ifelse(bass_comp$SITE == "MOHK" | bass_comp$SITE=="CARP", "CONTROL", "MPA")

##Group by MPA status and year. Get the mean of the two different states, by year 
bass_comp_avg = bass_comp %>% group_by(YEAR, status, SP_CODE) %>%

##Make a grouped column chart that shows avg bass size for each year inside and outside of MPAs 
## *Note: MPA status starts in 2012.

  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")

##Subset the data further to only include post mpa years for inside/outside

## Remake the grouped column chart with the subsetted years

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
