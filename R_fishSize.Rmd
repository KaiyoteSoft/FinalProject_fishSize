```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set("~/Biology/146/finalProject_fishSize")

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## R Markdown

```{r}
fishData <- read.csv("Annual_fish_comb_20200108.csv")
head(fishData)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## Subset data to only include kelp bass
bass1 <- subset(fishData, SP_CODE=="PCLA")

## Remove all -99999 from dataset
bass2 = bass1[-which(bass1$SIZE < 0),]

##
bass3 = bass2 %>% group_by(SITE, TRANSECT, SP_CODE, COMMON_NAME, SIZE, COUNT, AREA)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
