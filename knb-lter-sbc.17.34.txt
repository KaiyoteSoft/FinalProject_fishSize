    These data describe the abundance and size of fish species as part
    of SBCLTER's kelp forest monitoring program to track long-term
    patterns in species abundance and diversity. This study began in
    2000 in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. The abundance
    and size of all taxa of resident kelp forest fish encountered along
    permanent transects are recorded at nine reef sites located along
    the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel and at two sites on
    the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These sites reflect several
    oceanographic regimes in the channel and vary in distance from
    sources of terrestrial runoff. In these surveys, fish were counted
    in either a 40x2m benthic quadrat, or in the water parcel 0-2m off
    the bottom over the same area.
  
        
    The two tables in this data package include: 1) The annual benthic
    fish community survey which was conducted on 11 reefs once a year
    around late July or early August; and 2) The monthly fish survey
    which was conducted once a month at a subset of the sites (3 of the
    annual sites)
  
        
    The time period of data collection for the annual benthic fish
    community survey varied among the 11 kelp forest sites. Sampling at
    BULL, CARP, and NAPL began in 2000, sampling at the other 6 mainland
    sites (AHND, AQUE, IVEE, GOLB, ABUR, MOHK) began in 2001 (transects
    3, 5, 6, 7, 8 at IVEE were added in 2011). Data collection at the
    two Santa Cruz Island sites (SCTW and SCDI) began in 2004. The
    monthly fish survey at ABUR (Transect 1, 2, and 3), AQUE
    (Transect1), and MOHK (Transect 1) in 2002. The Transect 2 and 3 at
    ABUR were discontinued in June 2006.

    The benthic fish was surveyed using two methods: 1. Annual benthic
    fish community survey which was conducted on 11 sites once a year
    around late July or early August, and 2 The monthly fish survey
    which was conducted once a month at a subset of the sites.
  
            
    In the annual survey, the start time that data collection began
    differed among the sites and transects. Information on these
    differences are listed in a table accessible at:

    The monthly fish survey at ABUR (Transect 1, 2, and 3), AQUE

    ABUR were discontinued in June 2006.
  
            
    Count values were given a NA (-99999) if: (1) data were not
    collected for a particular species, (2) a datasheet was lost or (3)
    poor underwater visibility prevented fish from being surveyed

          The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate
            the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp
            (Macrocystis pyrifera ) forest ecosystems. As in many temperate
            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
            production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic
            interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.
